  Alters the case of each character based on comparison with the previous character (used in HackerRank test).

- **palindrome_check_basic.py**  
  Checks if a given string is a palindrome (ignores spaces and is case-insensitive).

- **vowelcount.py**

  Extracts all digits from a given string and prints their sum. If no digits are found, it notifies the user.

- **list_elementwise_sum.py**  
  Takes two lists of equal length as input and creates a new list with the sum of corresponding elements.

- **maths_game.py**  
  A simple math quiz game for kids. Generates 5 random arithmetic questions (+, ‚àí, √ó). Correct answers add 4 points, wrong answers deduct 2 points, and the final score is displayed with feedback.

- **unique_list.py**  
  Removes duplicate elements from a list and prints the unique elements in the order they first appeared.

- **string_initials.py**
