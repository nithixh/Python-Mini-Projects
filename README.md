# Python-Mini-Projects

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly Python programs written for practice and learning purposes. Each script covers a basic concept or logic-building exercise.

## 📁 Files Included

- **2x2_matrix_determinant.py**  
  Calculates the determinant of a 2x2 matrix using user input.

- **Second Largest.py**  
  Finds the second largest number in a list of user-provided numbers without using any inbuilt functions.

- **bits_count.py**  
  Counts the number of '1' bits in a given binary string (Hamming weight).

- **hackerrank.py**  
  Alters the case of each character based on comparison with the previous character (used in HackerRank test).

- **palindrome_check_basic.py**  
  Checks if a given string is a palindrome (ignores spaces and is case-insensitive).

- **vowelcount.py**  
  Counts the number of vowels in a given string.

- **vowel_sorter.py**  
  A simple Python script that extracts all vowels from an input string and prints them in the fixed order `aeiou`, repeating them based on how many times each appears.

- **thirukkural_adhigaram.py**  
  Given a Thirukkural number (1–1330), it outputs the corresponding *Adhigaram* (chapter).

- **AP_series.py**  
  Generates an Arithmetic Progression (AP) based on the first term, common difference, and number of terms. Prints the series along with the last term.

- **sum_of_digits_in_string.py**  
  Extracts all digits from a given string and prints their sum. If no digits are found, it notifies the user.

- **list_elementwise_sum.py**  
  Takes two lists of equal length as input and creates a new list with the sum of corresponding elements.

- **maths_game.py**  
  A simple math quiz game for kids. Generates 5 random arithmetic questions (+, −, ×). Correct answers add 4 points, wrong answers deduct 2 points, and the final score is displayed with feedback.

- **unique_list.py**  
  Removes duplicate elements from a list and prints the unique elements in the order they first appeared.

- **string_initials.py**  
  Converts a string to uppercase and prints the initials of each word (e.g., "Kongu Engineering College" → "KEC").
